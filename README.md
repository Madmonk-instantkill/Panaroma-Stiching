# Panaroma-Stiching
Panaroma images are one of the most popularly used images, They are created by stiching many images,by first identifying similar image features ,at which images can be stitched. In this project, we will take two images ,stitch it and create a paranoma image.We will be using sift detector and compute to first get image feature. As we are not using any matcher here and will be using simple  euclidean distance to get the pairs of common features, we will mask most part of both images and apply sift detector only on the parts which is common in both images. Ones the common features are obtained,we will create homography matrix amd finally use wrap perspective to stich the images.
